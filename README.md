# CamTrack

> Sophisticated Mechanical Object Tracking

## Introduction

Inspired by the manual operation of cameras on football pitches, our team set out with a goal to modernize the camera operation through singular object tracking for instant replays and multiple object tracking for the regular field of play.

## Details

During initial prototyping, out team used a PiCam and a self built platform stand to detect objects with the aid of the OpenCV API. The Raspberry Pi and Arduino motors coordinate movement through Serial Read/Writing to follow the object. Three motors are used to give the camera a full field of vision and rotation.

## Future Applications 

Other possible applications include home security in tracking specific targeted people. 

## Future Plans

After the initial rapid prototyping phase, the next phase is incorporating multiple cameras connected wirelessly to a central server, where machine learning will be used to display the best view.
