# CamTrack

> Ball in, ball out

## Introduction

Being the huge soccer fans that we are, we decided to try and improve the footage that we watch on a daily basis. We decided to create a tool that could automatically track a ball on a soccer field.

## Details

We used a raspberry pi camera and open cv to detect the ball. We used Serial reading and writing to communicate between our python code and the raspberry pi motor. The motor then turns in response and rotates the camera if needed. Thus, we have a camera that will automatically stop when the ball is in view which is useful.

## Applications 

Another area that our project could be implemented in is security and the tracking of specific objects/people.

## Future Plans
We want to incorporate multiple cameras and automatic switching between cameras based on which camera gives the best view of the ball/object.

## Built With
